You are implementing a new feature. Follow these rules STRICTLY:

1. FIRST, read all files in .cursor/rules/ directory, specifically workflow.mdc
2. Read tasks.json and PROGRESS.md if they exist
3. Create/update tasks.json with a detailed task breakdown for the feature
4. Present the task plan to me in a table format
5. WAIT for my approval before writing any code
6. Work on ONE task at a time
7. After each task: update tasks.json (passes: true), update PROGRESS.md, ask for review.
8. If context is running low: save state to PROGRESS.md, and tell me
