Continue the feature implementation from where we left off.

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. Read .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc
2. Read PROGRESS.md - find the "Context Handoff" section
3. Read tasks.json - find the first task where passes: false
4. Tell me what you found and what you'll work on next
5. Continue implementation following the rules

Do NOT start coding until you've reported the current state to me.
